# Cursor Rules for KG-Sentiment Project

## Architecture Documentation (Automated)

Architecture documentation is automatically generated on every commit via:
- Git pre-commit hook â†’ `scripts/update_architecture.py`
- Uses GPT-4o to analyze entire codebase
- Generates comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md with Mermaid diagrams

If you need to manually regenerate:
1. Run: `python scripts/update_architecture.py`
2. Or ask: "Update architecture documentation"

## Manual Architecture Update

When the user says "update architecture" or "update docs":
1. Analyze the entire codebase (flows/, pipeline/, src/)
2. Generate comprehensive ARCHITECTURE.md with:
   - Component summary table with counts
   - Mermaid system architecture diagram
   - Mermaid pipeline state diagram  
   - Mermaid data model class diagram
   - Mermaid sequence diagram
   - Component details with actual classes/functions found
   - Technology stack analysis
   - Directory structure
3. Write to documentation/ARCHITECTURE.md
4. Include current timestamp

## Code Analysis Guidelines

When analyzing code:
- Parse actual Python files to extract structure
- Identify Prefect @flow and @task decorators
- Extract class names, function names, imports
- Identify dependencies and relationships
- Create accurate diagrams based on real code structure
- Focus on how components interact

## Documentation Style

Follow the workspace rules for elegance and conciseness.
