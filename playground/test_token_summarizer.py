Thank you very much. Very much appreciate it. And I don't mind making this speech without a teleprompter because the teleprompter is not working. 
I feel very happy to be up here with you nevertheless. And that way, you speak more from the heart. 
I can only say that whoever's operating this teleprompter is in big trouble.

Hello, Madam First Lady. Thank you very much for being here, and Madam President, Mr. Secretary General, First Lady of the United States, 
distinguished delegates, ambassadors and world leaders. Six years have passed since I last stood in this grand hall and addressed a world 
that was prosperous and at peace in my first term. Since that day, the guns of war have shattered the peace I forged on two continents.

An era of calm and stability gave way to one of the great crisises of our time. And here in the United States, four years of weakness, 
lawlessness and radicalism under the last administration delivered our nation into a repeated set of disasters. One year ago our country 
was in deep trouble. But today, just eight months into my administration, we are the hottest country anywhere in the world.

And there is no other country even close. America is blessed with the strongest economy, the strongest borders, the strongest military, 
the strongest friendships and the strongest spirit of any nation on the face of the earth. This is indeed the Golden Age of America. 
We are rapidly reversing the economic calamity that we inherited from the previous administration, including ruinous price increases 
and record setting inflation, inflation like we've never had before.

Under my leadership, energy costs are down, gasoline prices are down, grocery prices are down, mortgage rates are down and inflation 
has been defeated. The only thing that's up is the stock market, which just hit a record high. In fact, it's hit a record high 48 times 
in the last short period of time. Growth is surging.

Manufacturing is booming. The stock market, as I said, is doing better than it's ever done, and all of you in this room benefit by that, 
almost everybody. And importantly, worker's wages are rising at the fastest pace in more than 60 years. And that's what it's all about, isn't it?

When I took office, we were facing unprecedented challenges that threatened the very foundation of our great nation. The economy was in shambles, 
our borders were wide open, and our allies had lost confidence in American leadership. But I made a promise to the American people that I would 
make America great again, and that's exactly what we've done.

The numbers speak for themselves. Unemployment has reached historic lows across all demographics. Black unemployment, Hispanic unemployment, 
Asian unemployment, women's unemployment - all at record lows. We've created millions of new jobs, more than any administration in history. 
The stock market has hit record highs over 200 times since I took office. GDP growth has been strong and consistent.

On trade, we've renegotiated terrible deals that were destroying our manufacturing base. The NAFTA replacement, the USMCA, is much better for 
American workers. We've imposed tariffs on China to stop their unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft. We've brought back 
manufacturing jobs that were lost for decades.

In foreign policy, we've achieved peace through strength. We've rebuilt our military, which was depleted by previous administrations. 
We've made historic progress with North Korea, something that was unthinkable just a few years ago. We've taken on ISIS and defeated them 
completely. We've moved our embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing the reality that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.

On energy, we've become energy independent for the first time in decades. We've opened up federal lands for oil and gas exploration, 
creating thousands of jobs and reducing energy costs for American families. We've supported clean coal technology and nuclear energy, 
making America the world's energy superpower.

Healthcare has been a priority. We've repealed the individual mandate from Obamacare, giving Americans more freedom in their healthcare choices. 
We've worked to lower prescription drug costs and increase transparency in healthcare pricing. We've supported association health plans 
and health savings accounts to give people more affordable options.

Education reform has been another focus. We've expanded school choice and charter schools, giving parents more options for their children's 
education. We've worked to reduce student loan debt and make college more affordable. We've supported vocational training and apprenticeships 
to prepare students for good-paying jobs that don't require a four-year degree.

Infrastructure has been a key priority. We've invested in roads, bridges, airports, and broadband internet. The infrastructure bill we passed 
will create millions of jobs and modernize our transportation systems. We're building the wall on our southern border to stop illegal immigration 
and drug trafficking.

On immigration, we've taken strong action to secure our borders and enforce our laws. We've ended catch and release, built hundreds of miles 
of new border wall, and deployed thousands of additional border patrol agents. We've worked with Mexico and Central American countries to 
address the root causes of illegal immigration.

Criminal justice reform has been another major achievement. We passed the First Step Act, which gives non-violent offenders a second chance 
and reduces recidivism. We've supported police departments across the country and worked to build trust between law enforcement and communities.

Technology and innovation have been priorities. We've supported American tech companies while ensuring fair competition. We've worked to 
expand broadband internet access to rural areas. We've supported research and development in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, 
and other cutting-edge technologies.

The environment is important to all of us. We've promoted clean air and clean water while balancing environmental protection with economic growth. 
We've supported renewable energy development while maintaining energy independence. We've worked with other countries on climate issues 
while putting America first.

Tax reform was one of our biggest accomplishments. We cut taxes for middle-class families and businesses, leading to economic growth and job creation. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act simplified the tax code and made America more competitive internationally. Small businesses saw immediate benefits 
from the tax cuts.

Regulatory reform has been crucial for economic growth. We've eliminated thousands of unnecessary regulations that were holding back businesses. 
We've implemented a two-for-one rule, requiring agencies to eliminate two regulations for every new one they create. This has saved businesses 
billions of dollars in compliance costs.

Space exploration has been revitalized. We've established the Space Force as a new branch of the military. We've set a goal of returning 
Americans to the Moon and eventually sending them to Mars. We've supported private space companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin.

Veterans affairs has been a priority. We've reformed the VA system to provide better healthcare for our veterans. We've expanded mental health 
services and suicide prevention programs. We've worked to eliminate the backlog of disability claims and improve the appeals process.

Agriculture has been supported through difficult times. We've provided assistance to farmers affected by trade disputes and natural disasters. 
We've expanded agricultural exports and opened new markets for American farmers. We've supported rural broadband and infrastructure development.

Small businesses have been a focus throughout my administration. We've reduced taxes and regulations that were burdening small business owners. 
We've expanded access to capital through the Small Business Administration. We've supported minority-owned and women-owned businesses 
through various programs.

The opioid crisis has been addressed with a comprehensive approach. We've increased funding for treatment and prevention programs. 
We've worked with other countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs into our country. We've supported law enforcement efforts to 
crack down on drug trafficking.

Housing has been addressed through various initiatives. We've worked to increase homeownership rates, especially among minorities. 
We've reformed the housing finance system and supported affordable housing programs. We've addressed homelessness in major cities 
through targeted assistance programs.

Transportation infrastructure has been modernized. We've invested in airports, highways, and public transit systems. We've supported 
high-speed rail projects and electric vehicle infrastructure. We've worked to reduce traffic congestion in major metropolitan areas.

Cybersecurity has been strengthened across all sectors. We've established new standards for protecting critical infrastructure. 
We've worked with the private sector to improve cybersecurity practices. We've created new agencies and programs to combat cyber threats.

Artificial intelligence has been supported as a national priority. We've invested in AI research and development. We've worked to ensure 
America leads in AI technology while addressing ethical concerns. We've supported AI education and workforce development programs.

Quantum computing has been identified as a critical technology. We've increased funding for quantum research and development. 
We've worked with universities and private companies to advance quantum technology. We've established quantum research centers 
across the country.

5G technology has been prioritized for national security and economic competitiveness. We've worked to deploy 5G networks across America. 
We've supported American companies in the global 5G competition. We've addressed security concerns about foreign 5G equipment.

Biotechnology has been supported through various initiatives. We've invested in biomedical research and development. We've worked to 
accelerate the development of new treatments and cures. We've supported the biotechnology industry through tax incentives and 
regulatory reform.

Advanced manufacturing has been promoted through various programs. We've invested in manufacturing research and development.
